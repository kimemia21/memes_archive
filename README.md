Welcome to Memes Archive, the one-stop-shop for your meme collection that’s more organized than your life. Why keep scrolling through your phone like a confused pigeon when you can store your memes like the treasures they are? Here, we don’t just save memes — we immortalize them.

# Features 🎉
1. Meme Hoarding, But Make It Fancy:
Dump all your top-tier memes in one place. Forget hunting through your camera roll full of screenshots, old receipts, and that one blurry photo of your dog.

# Tag It Like a Pro:
Need a meme for “When you’ve only had one coffee but life wants five meetings”? Or maybe one for roasting your friend who can’t parallel park? Sorted.

# Search on Steroids:
Type a word, and boom — the perfect meme appears faster than you can say, “I sent you this one already.”

# Contribute & Be a Meme Hero:
Upload your gems and become part of the Meme Illuminati. Sharing is caring — unless it’s the last slice of pizza.

# Tech Stack 🛠️
Frontend: So slick it’s practically wearing a leather jacket.
Backend: Tougher than explaining memes to your parents.
Database: Organised like your mum’s spice rack.
Why Memes Archive? 🤔
Because memes are the glue holding this chaotic world together. Where else are you gonna stash that “Me waiting for the pizza delivery” meme? Memes are life, and we’re just living in their timeline.
